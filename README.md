# Hierarchical Open-vocabulary Universal Image Segmentation

**HIPIE** can provide high-quality class-aware image segmentation for a wide range of objects/parts. We consider all relevant tasks under the unified framework of language-guided segmentation, which performs open-vocabulary segmentation and detection tasks for arbitrary text-based descriptions.

*Currently, this repo contains only codes for demos. Stay tuned.*  


## Installation
Please refer to [INSTALL.md](assets/INSTALL.md) for more details.  


## Demos
-  See  [Demo-Main](notebooks/Demo-Main.ipynb) for Panoptic, Part, Instance and Referring Segmentation
-  See  [Demo-SD](notebooks/Inpaint.ipynb) for Combining our model with Stable Diffusion
-  See  [Demo-SAM](notebooks/Demo-HIPIE+SAM.ipynb) for Combining our model with Segment Anything


## Model Zoo
We release two [checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_kD3XILU1DC8uGn4vMGHgglDVlCl1U0W?usp=sharing) at the moment.

- ResNet-50 Pretrained with O365,COCO,RefCOCO,Pascal Panoptic Parts
- ViT-H Pretrained with O365,COCO,RefCOCO


## ToDos
We will release training and evlautation code with more checkpoints soon.
